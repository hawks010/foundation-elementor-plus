Foundation Elementor Plus is Inkfire's modular Elementor widget suite for Foundation-powered WordPress sites.

== Description ==

Foundation Elementor Plus packages the custom Elementor widgets, shared helpers, admin settings, and integrations used across Inkfire's Foundation builds.

Key points:

* Preserves live Elementor widget slugs and saved control IDs.
* Registers widget CSS and JavaScript only for enabled widgets.
* Includes a production-oriented admin settings screen for widget toggles and integrations.
* Supports GitHub release-based plugin updates without depending on WordPress.org.
* Keeps uninstall cleanup scoped to plugin-owned options and transient caches.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `foundation-elementor-plus` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate `Foundation Elementor Plus` in WordPress.
3. Ensure Elementor is installed and active.
4. Open `Foundation > Elementor Plus` to review enabled widgets and integrations.

== GitHub Updates ==

This plugin includes a built-in GitHub updater aimed at the repository:

`hawks010/foundation-elementor-plus`

Recommended release flow:

1. Push plugin changes to the GitHub repository.
2. Create a GitHub release whose tag matches the plugin version, for example `1.3.4`.
3. WordPress will detect the newer release in the plugin updates screen.

If the repository is private, add a token in `wp-config.php`:

`define( 'FOUNDATION_ELEMENTOR_PLUS_GITHUB_TOKEN', 'your-github-token-here' );`

The token should have at least repository read access for the target repository.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will uninstall delete Elementor content? =

No. The uninstall routine removes plugin-owned options, counters, and transient caches only. Elementor content stored in posts is left intact.

= Can I preserve plugin settings on uninstall? =

Yes. Add this to `wp-config.php` before deleting the plugin:

`define( 'FOUNDATION_ELEMENTOR_PLUS_PRESERVE_DATA', true );`
